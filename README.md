Developed a web crawler using Python and utilized the ScrappingBee API to access the search results for the Google query "site:youtube.com openinapp.co". As Google search only shows the first 300 results, the use of an API allowed the crawler to extract the links to YouTube channels beyond the 300 limit. The crawler was able to scrape the links to YouTube channels and returned the data in both JSON and CSV formats. The use of IP proxies was implemented to ensure proper web scraping and avoid getting blocked by the target website. This project showcases skills in web scraping, data extraction, API integration, and the use of proxies using Pytho
